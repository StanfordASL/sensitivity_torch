Optimization Sensitivity in PyTorch - Reference Documentation - First- and Second-order Optimization
====================================================================================================

``sensitivity_torch`` is a package designed to allow taking first- and
**second-order** derivatives through optimization or any other fixed-point
process.

Source code for this package is located `here: github.com/rdyro/sensitivity_torch <https://github.com/rdyro/sensitivity_torch>`_.

This package builds on top of `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_. We also
maintain an implementation in `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_
`here <https://rdyro.github.io/sensitivity_jax/>`_.
